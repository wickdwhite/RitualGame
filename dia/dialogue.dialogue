Niyana: ...
Niyana: It's strange being back here again after all this time. 
Niyana: Strange seeing the home you insisted on keeping so tidy and spotless all the time collecting dust and fractures.
Niyana: So little has changed... yet I find myself a stranger to it all. The years have hollowed this place, as they have hollowed me.
Niyana: It's colder than I remember...
Niyana: Or maybe... it's just me.
Niyana: ...
Niyana: I kept my promise. 
Niyana: Kept away for long enough that I've even forgotton my sense of self.
Niyana: But, you know...
Niyana: I've walked the breadth of a few lifetimes... yet every road returns me here. I always knew that. No matter where I went, no matter what I did, I would find my way back here... to you.
Niyana: Just one step more. One breath more. 
#Niyana: [[Hi|Hello|Howdy]] Here are some choices. 
#- First one
#	Nathan: You picked the first one.
#- Second one
#	Nathan: You picked the second one.
#- Start again => start
#- End the conversation => END
#Nathan: For more information see the online documentation.

~ letter1
Niyana: This letter is...
Niyana: I'd recognize this handwriting anywhere.
Niyana: We wrote to each other often, but I... I've never seen this one
Niyana: Are there more around? 
=> END

~ letter2
Niyana: How useless am I that I took eons to take notice of your... hate.
Niyana: How useless, to rob us of more time we could've had together.
=> END

~ letter3
Niyana: I... remember that day.
Niyana: I wish I'd been braver to voice my affections then
Niyana: Openly
Niyana: Without fear or reservation. Without the walls to hide us
Niyana: Maybe then... it never would've come to this.
=> END

~ letter4
Niyana: I'd picked out that clock personally for you. It frustrated me that it wasn't perfect.
Niyana: Hah... we had so many pointless conversations and useless quarrels.
Niyana: ...
Niyana: What I wouldn't give to have one with you right now.
=> END

~ letter5
Niyana: That's right... our precious little hellion...
Niyana: Disappeared one night and never returned.
Niyana: I hope she lived well.
=> END

~ letter6
Niyana: That's right... the painting that started it all.
Niyana: Presented you with a cure to your quietest fear that never quite dissipated, despite your honeyed reassurances.
Niyana: I was no stranger to seeing you empassioned--absorbed into your studies, enraptured in your romantic prose--but... it was never like that. It was different that time.
Niyana: I never held the same anxieties, I was content to fade and be forgotten as long as I had you now, ephemeral as it was.
Niyana: But you... you did not want that fate for either of us. I'd resisted the idea for so long. I know it bothered you, bur you respected my decision nevertheless.
Niyana: ...
Niyana: Your patience paid off in the end... because who could resist the notion of eternity with you?
Niyana: ...
Niyana: Or perhaps it didn't. Because it never does turn out the way we hope, does it?
